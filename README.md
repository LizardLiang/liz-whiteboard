# liz-whiteboard — Real-Time Collaborative ER Diagram & Database Schema Designer

> **Open-source, self-hostable entity-relationship (ER) diagram editor for designing database schemas in the browser** — with real-time multiplayer collaboration and a built-in **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** so AI agents like **Claude** and **Cursor** can read and edit your diagrams.

liz-whiteboard is a **collaborative database design tool** — think a focused, self-hosted alternative to dbdiagram.io, drawSQL, or the diagram side of DataGrip — for sketching **entity-relationship diagrams**, modelling **SQL database schemas**, and documenting data models. It runs as a single Bun process backed by an embedded SQLite database, so you can self-host the whole thing from one container.

## Features

- 🎨 **Visual ER diagram editor** — drag-and-drop tables, columns, and relationships on an infinite canvas (powered by [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/)).
- 🧱 **Rich schema modelling** — 25 SQL **data types** (`int`, `varchar`, `uuid`, `json`, `timestamp`, …) and 17 relationship **cardinalities** (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, and zero/optional variants).
- 🔑 **Keys & constraints** — primary keys, foreign keys, unique, nullable, and column ordering.
- 👥 **Real-time multiplayer collaboration** — multiple users edit the same whiteboard live over Socket.IO (create/update/move/delete broadcast instantly).
- 🗂️ **Projects, folders & whiteboards** — organise many diagrams per project.
- 🔐 **Accounts & sessions** — email/password authentication with secure session cookies.
- 🪪 **Built-in OAuth 2.1 Authorization Server** — issue access tokens (PKCE, JWKS) for first-party and AI clients.
- 🤖 **AI-ready (MCP)** — a companion [Model Context Protocol server](https://github.com/LizardLiang/liz-whiteboard-mcp) lets LLM agents (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code) **read and edit your ER diagrams** programmatically.
- 📦 **Self-hosted & portable** — one SQLite file, one Docker image, no external database required.

## Why liz-whiteboard

- **Own your data.** Self-host on your own machine or server; everything lives in a single `data/app.db` SQLite file.
- **Design databases faster.** A canvas built specifically for entity-relationship modelling and SQL schema design — not a generic drawing tool.
- **Collaborate in real time.** Share a whiteboard and design schemas together, live.
- **Automate with AI.** Generate or refactor schemas with an LLM through the MCP integration instead of clicking every table by hand.

## Tech stack

- **Runtime:** [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- **Framework:** [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) (React 19, SSR) + [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router), [Query](https://tanstack.com/query), and [Form](https://tanstack.com/form)
- **Canvas:** [React Flow / @xyflow/react](https://reactflow.dev/)
- **Realtime:** [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/)
- **Database:** SQLite (raw SQL data layer, schema auto-created on first run)
- **Auth:** session cookies + OAuth 2.1 (PKCE, JWKS) via [`jose`](https://github.com/panva/jose)
- **UI:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) + [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) / [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **Validation:** [Zod](https://zod.dev/)

## Quick start (development)

Requirements: [Bun](https://bun.sh/) `1.2+`.

```bash
bun install
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # if present; otherwise see Configuration below
bun run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:3000**. The dev script runs the Vite app and the Socket.IO collaboration server together. The SQLite schema is created automatically on first connect; seed sample data with:

```bash
bun run db:seed
```

## Run with Docker

```bash
bun run docker:build      # docker build -t liz-whiteboard:test .
bun run docker:run        # docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 liz-whiteboard:test
```

The image bundles the web app, the OAuth Authorization Server, and the real-time collaboration server in one container with an embedded SQLite database. For a **full stack behind a single domain** (app + AI/MCP server fronted by a reverse proxy), see the Docker Compose setup in [liz-whiteboard-mcp](https://github.com/LizardLiang/liz-whiteboard-mcp).

## AI / MCP integration (edit diagrams with Claude & Cursor)

liz-whiteboard ships a companion **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server**: **[liz-whiteboard-mcp](https://github.com/LizardLiang/liz-whiteboard-mcp)**. It exposes 19 tools that let AI agents list projects and whiteboards, read the full schema and per-table DDL, and create/update/delete tables, columns, and relationships (individually or in a single batch) — all authenticated through this app's OAuth 2.1 server. Point Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP client at it to design databases conversationally.

## Configuration

Configuration is via environment variables (loaded from `.env.local` in development).

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | SQLite database file, e.g. `file:./data/app.db` (absolute path recommended in production). |
| `OAUTH_ISSUER` | Public issuer URL of the built-in Authorization Server (e.g. `https://your-domain`). |
| `MCP_RESOURCE_URI` | Canonical URI of the MCP resource server (e.g. `https://your-domain/mcp`) — used as the OAuth token audience. |
| `COLLAB_RESOURCE_URI` | Audience for internal collaboration tokens (defaults to the app origin). |
| `MCP_CLIENT_SECRET` | Shared secret the MCP backend uses to mint collaboration tokens (`/api/collab-token`). |
| `OAUTH_SIGNING_KEY_FILE` / `OAUTH_SIGNING_KEY_PRIVATE` | RS256 signing key (PKCS#8 PEM) for OAuth tokens — set a **persistent** key in production. `OAUTH_SIGNING_KEY_KID` sets its key id. |
| `DEBUG_SUPER_PASSWORD` | Optional dev-only login bypass (never set in production). |

## Testing

```bash

bun run check          # prettier + eslint
```

## Roadmap

- Role-based access control for shared projects (membership model exists; enforcement is being finalised)
- SQL / DBML export and import
- Dynamic client registration (DCR) and a consent screen for third-party MCP clients
